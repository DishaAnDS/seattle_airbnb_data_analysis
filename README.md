# Airbnb Data Analysis
This is a project to analyze the Seattle Airbnb data to find insights and conduct some simple models.
### Libraries Used
`pandas`: for dataframe manipulation. <br/>
`seaborn`: for data visualization. <br/>
`matplotlib`: for data visualization.<br/>
`sklearn`: for modeling and prediction result evaluation. <br/>
`random`: for getting the random numbers. <br/>
### Motivation
By analyzing the Seattle Airbnb dataset to find out major contributed features to the property price, explore the seasonality of listed price difference from the average, and predict the price of listed properties.
### Files Description
`seattle_analysis.ipynb`: the Jupyter Notebook that includes all the analysis and code. <br/>
`seattle`: the folder that includes the data has been used. <br/>
`medium_tables`: evaluation metrics produced by the analysis. <br/>
### Summary of Results
Features such as accommodates , bedrooms, beds, weekly_price, security_deposit, cleaning_fee, guests_included have a strong relationship with the prices of different properties.
The properties listed longer time tend to set different prices for their prices.
Itâ€™s able to predict our price. But the current exploration is not good enough to give good accuracy. Further investigation needs to be conducted.
